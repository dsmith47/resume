# Resume LaTex Storage

Stores latex files for resume somewhere where their changes are easy to interact
with. Also stores pdfs in case they become useful.

## Directory Layout

### Root Level

Root level holds long-running job history. It's not technically a resume
(since it compiles to over 1 page), but it's good to log all job history
somewhere, since older experience could be very relevant to a specific job in
the future.

### Resume Archive

Resumes issued for a time/purose are backed up here, as a reference to what
was/wasn't included in them. Names should start with `resume-YYYY-MM-DD-*`.
